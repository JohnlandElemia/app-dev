 3.Spiderman 🕷️ 🕸️
|Spider-Man in film dates back to 1977, the rights belonging to Marvel until 1999, when Sony bought them for $7 million.[1] He has been Marvel's most successful character in the cinema industry ever since. After selling the Spider-Man motion picture rights to Sony, Marvel eventually founded its own studio, developing the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) based on the characters they still held the rights to. This would change in 2016, when Sony and Disney[2] entered an agreement to include Spider-Man in the MCU. Despite some disagreements pertaining to finances and merchandising between the two parties, the agreement proved to be a successful endeavor for both companies. The following two Avengers sequels, finally with Spider-Man, crossed the two-billion-dollar mark at the worldwide box office for the first time. Meanwhile, Sony in association with Marvel[3] launched the Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU), with Sony entering a three-billion-dollar streaming agreement with Netflix and Disney.[4]| SPIDERMAN|

5. Captain America 🛡️
|Captain America is a superhero created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby who appears in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in Captain America Comics #1, published on December 20, 1940, by Timely Comics, a corporate predecessor to Marvel. Captain America's civilian identity is Steven "Steve" Rogers, a frail man enhanced to the peak of human physical perfection by an experimental "super-soldier serum" after joining the United States Army to aid the country's efforts in World War II. Equipped with an American flag–inspired costume and a virtually indestructible shield, Captain America and his sidekick Bucky Barnes clashed frequently with the villainous Red Skull and other members of the Axis powers. In the final days of the war, an accident left Captain America frozen in a state of suspended animation until he was revived in modern times. He resumes his exploits as a costumed hero and becomes leader of the superhero team the Avengers, but frequently struggles as a "man out of time" to adjust to the new era|CAPTAIN AMERICA|
